# SIT120_Assignment1-Pt1

This is where I've kept my files for this assignment. The "bookshelf.jpg" is the header image on the website, which is hosted here and linked to in my website.
If you want to view the code for my website, the html and css files are here in the repository. If you want to view the website, use the following link:

I've also included the project proposal PDF here just in case it doesn't send through properly.

Looking forward to hearing your feedback on my submission.
